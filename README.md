# Platformer prototype

This program is a prototype of a platformer. Most of the infrastructure required to make a full game is ready, including file formats for the levels, but the project remains incomplete.

# Usage

1. Make sure you have [python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Ashwagandhae/platformer
cd platformer
```

3. Next, install the packages

```
pip3 install pygame
```

4. Finally, run the program

```
python3 main.py
```
